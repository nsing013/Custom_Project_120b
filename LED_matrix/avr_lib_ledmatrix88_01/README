This library implements a simple 8x8 led matrix for AVR Atmega.
It uses 16 output ports for the full 8x8 led matrix, but it can be reduced
to a smaller matrix, using less ports.

Setup parameters are stored in file ledmatrix88.h


Devel Notes
-----------
This library was developed on Eclipse, built with avr-gcc on Atmega8 @ 1MHz.
